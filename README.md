2. [Attempted to set up express](https://github.com/lovincyrus/cosmos-hub/commit/f042b1af69505d15df3b1191c4d3d33439d857a9) and use Tendermint RPC in local machine. 
3. Use `https://rpc.nylira.net` instead
4. Input number and search for a particular block - which API? [ðŸ¤”](https://cosmos.network/rpc/#/)
5. `/staking/delegators/{delegatorAddr}/delegations` & `/staking/validators/{validatorAddr}` are not available on [rpc.nylira.net](https://rpc.nylira.net)
